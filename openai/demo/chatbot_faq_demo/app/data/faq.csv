How do I get popular services free for 12 months?,"When you create your Azure free account, you start getting monthly free amounts of certain types of services. If you move to pay-as-you-go pricing within 30 days or after you’ve used your credit, you’ll continue to receive monthly free amounts of popular services until 12 months after you created your account. After that, if you’re using any of these services, they’ll continue to run and you’ll be billed for them at pay-as-you-go rates."
How do I get the 55+ other services that are always free?,"You start getting monthly free amounts of more than 55 other services when you create your Azure free account. If you move to pay-as-you-go pricing after 30 days or after you use your credit, you’ll continue to receive monthly free amounts of these services. If you exceed your monthly free amounts for any of these services, you’ll be billed for them at pay-as-you-go rates."
What can I do with my $200 credit?,"You can apply your credit to try services that aren't in the free list, or to use more than your free amounts of any services."
Who is eligible for the Azure free account?,"The Azure free account is available to all new Azure customers who haven't previously had an Azure free account and received a $200 credit."
Do I pay anything to start with the Azure free account?,"No. Starting is free. You won't be charged anything unless you decide to move to pay-as-you-go pricing."
How do I ensure that I won’t be charged?,"We’ll never charge you unless you decide to move to pay-as-you-go pricing. If you move to pay as you go, you’ll only be charged for services that you use above the free monthly amounts. You can check your usage of free services in the Azure portal."
Do I have to pay something after 30 days or after I use up my credit?,"At the end of your first 30 days or after you spend your $200 credit (whichever comes first), we'll ask you if you want to move to pay-as-you-go pricing. If you move to pay as you go, you'll keep getting free services and you'll only pay for what you use beyond the free monthly amounts. If you don't move to pay as you go, you can't purchase Azure services beyond your $200 credit—and eventually your account and services will be disabled."
Can I skip the 30 days and just start with pay-as-you-go pricing?,"Yes. You can sign up directly for pay as you go. This will enable you to immediately use services beyond the free amounts at pay-as-you-go rates. You'll still get monthly free amounts of popular services for 12 months and more than 55 services that are always free, but you won't receive the $200 credit."
What happens once I use my $200 free credit or I’m at the end of 30 days?,"We’ll notify you so you can decide if you want to move to pay-as-you-go pricing, enabling you to purchase Azure services beyond free amounts. If you do, you’ll keep getting access to all the free services. If you don’t, your account and services will be disabled. To resume usage, you'll need to move to pay as you go."
What does it mean to upgrade my account to pay as you go?,"When you sign up for an Azure free account, you get $200 credit. In the first 30 days, any services you use beyond their free amounts will be deducted from that $200 credit. When you've used up your $200 credit or 30 days have passed (whichever happens first), you'll need to upgrade by moving to pay-as-you-go pricing. That way, you can keep getting free amounts of services and purchase services beyond their free amounts as needed. The cost of those services is charged to the payment method you provide."
What happens with the services if I don’t move to pay as you go?,"If you decide not to move to pay-as-you-go pricing after your first 30 days or once you've used up your $200 credit (whichever happens first), any services you've deployed will be decommissioned and you won't be able to access them. To regain access, move to pay as you go within the following 30 days."
How do I know how much of the $200 credit I have left?,"You can see your remaining credit under Microsoft Cost Management in the Azure portal."
What happens to my unused credit if I upgrade before the end of 30 days?,"If you move to pay-as-you-go pricing before the end of 30 days, you won’t lose your credit. When you move to pay as you go, any credit you have remaining will still be available for the full 30 days from when you created your free account."
What happens at the end of the 12 months?,"Once you move to pay-as-you-go pricing, certain types of popular services are available in free monthly amounts for 12 months. If you're using any of these services after 12 months, they'll continue to run and you'll be billed at pay-as-you-go rates. You'll continue to receive monthly free amounts of more than 55 services that are always free."
What do I need to sign up for a free account?,"All you need is a phone number, a credit card or a debit card (non-prepaid), and a Microsoft account username (formerly Windows Live ID)."
"Which Azure regions currently provide AKS?","To see the list of regions where AKS is available, see the Azure services by region page."
"Can I spread an AKS cluster across regions?","No. AKS clusters are regional resources and can't span regions. See best practices for business continuity and disaster recovery for guidance on how to create an architecture that includes multiple regions."
"Can I spread an AKS cluster across availability zones?","Yes. You can deploy an AKS cluster across one or more availability zones in regions that support them."
"Can I limit who has access to the Kubernetes API server?","Yes. There are two options for limiting access to the API server:\n\nUse API Server Authorized IP Ranges if you want to maintain a public endpoint for the API server but restrict access to a set of trusted IP ranges.\nUse a private cluster if you want to limit the API server to only be accessible from within your virtual network."
"Can I have different VM sizes in a single cluster?","Yes, you can use different virtual machine sizes in your AKS cluster by creating multiple node pools."
"Are security updates applied to AKS agent nodes?","AKS patches CVEs that have a 'vendor fix' every week. CVEs without a fix are waiting on a 'vendor fix' before it can be remediated. The AKS images are automatically updated inside of 30 days. We recommend you apply an updated Node Image on a regular cadence to ensure that latest patched images and OS patches are all applied and current. You can do this using one of the following methods:\n\nManually, through the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.\nBy upgrading your AKS cluster. The cluster upgrades cordon and drain nodes automatically and then bring a new node online with the latest Ubuntu image and a new patch version or a minor Kubernetes version. For more information, see Upgrade an AKS cluster.\nBy using node image upgrade."
"What's the size limit on a container image in AKS?","AKS doesn't set a limit on the container image size. However, it's important to understand that the larger the image, the higher the memory demand. A larger size could potentially exceed resource limits or the overall available memory of worker nodes. By default, memory for VM size Standard_DS2_v2 for an AKS cluster is set to 7 GiB.\n\nWhen a container image is excessively large, as in the Terabyte (TBs) range, kubelet might not be able to pull it from your container registry to a node due to lack of disk space."
"Windows Server nodes","For Windows Server nodes, Windows Update doesn't automatically run and apply the latest updates. On a regular schedule around the Windows Update release cycle and your own validation process, you should perform an upgrade on the cluster and the Windows Server node pool(s) in your AKS cluster. This upgrade process creates nodes that run the latest Windows Server image and patches, then removes the older nodes. For more information on this process, see Upgrade a node pool in AKS."
"Can I move/migrate my cluster between Azure tenants?","Moving your AKS cluster between tenants is currently unsupported."
"Can I move/migrate my cluster between subscriptions?","Movement of clusters between subscriptions is currently unsupported."
"Can I move my AKS clusters from the current Azure subscription to another?","Moving your AKS cluster and its associated resources between Azure subscriptions isn't supported."
"Can I move my AKS cluster or AKS infrastructure resources to other resource groups or rename them?","Moving or renaming your AKS cluster and its associated resources isn't supported."
"Why is my cluster delete taking so long?","Most clusters are deleted upon user request. In some cases, especially cases where you bring your own Resource Group or perform cross-RG tasks, deletion can take more time or even fail. If you have an issue with deletes, double-check that you don't have locks on the RG, that any resources outside of the RG are disassociated from the RG, and so on."
"Can I restore my cluster after deleting it?","No, you're unable to restore your cluster after deleting it. When you delete your cluster, the associated resource group and all its resources are deleted. If you want to keep any of your resources, move them to another resource group before deleting your cluster. If you have the Owner or User Access Administrator built-in role, you can lock Azure resources to protect them from accidental deletions and modifications. For more information, see Lock your resources to protect your infrastructure."
"What is platform support, and what does it include?","Platform support is a reduced support plan for unsupported 'N-3' version clusters. Platform support only includes Azure infrastructure support. Platform support doesn't include anything related to the following: Kubernetes functionality and components, Cluster or node pool creation, Hotfixes, Bug fixes, Security patches, Retired components. For more information on restrictions, see the platform support policy. AKS relies on the releases and patches from Kubernetes, which is an Open Source project that only supports a sliding window of three minor versions. AKS can only guarantee full support while those versions are being serviced upstream. Since there's no more patches being produced upstream, AKS can either leave those versions unpatched or fork. Due to this limitation, platform support doesn't support anything from relying on kubernetes upstream."
"Does AKS automatically upgrade my unsupported clusters?","AKS initiates auto-upgrades for unsupported clusters. When a cluster in an n-3 version (where n is the latest supported AKS GA minor version) is about to drop to n-4, AKS automatically upgrades the cluster to n-2 to remain in an AKS support policy. Automatically upgrading a platform supported cluster to a supported version is enabled by default. For example, kubernetes v1.25 upgrades to v1.26 during the v1.29 GA release. To minimize disruptions, set up maintenance windows. See auto-upgrade for details on automatic upgrade channels."
"If I have pod / deployments in state 'NodeLost' or 'Unknown' can I still upgrade my cluster?","You can, but we don't recommend it. You should perform updates when the state of the cluster is known and healthy."
"If I have a cluster with one or more nodes in an Unhealthy state or shut down, can I perform an upgrade?","No, delete/remove any nodes in a failed state or otherwise from the cluster before upgrading."
