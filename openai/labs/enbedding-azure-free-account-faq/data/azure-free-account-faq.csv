How do I get popular services free for 12 months?,"When you create your Azure free account, you start getting monthly free amounts of certain types of services. If you move to pay-as-you-go pricing within 30 days or after you’ve used your credit, you’ll continue to receive monthly free amounts of popular services until 12 months after you created your account. After that, if you’re using any of these services, they’ll continue to run and you’ll be billed for them at pay-as-you-go rates."
How do I get the 55+ other services that are always free?,"You start getting monthly free amounts of more than 55 other services when you create your Azure free account. If you move to pay-as-you-go pricing after 30 days or after you use your credit, you’ll continue to receive monthly free amounts of these services. If you exceed your monthly free amounts for any of these services, you’ll be billed for them at pay-as-you-go rates."
What can I do with my $200 credit?,"You can apply your credit to try services that aren't in the free list, or to use more than your free amounts of any services."
Who is eligible for the Azure free account?,"The Azure free account is available to all new Azure customers who haven't previously had an Azure free account and received a $200 credit."
Do I pay anything to start with the Azure free account?,"No. Starting is free. You won't be charged anything unless you decide to move to pay-as-you-go pricing."
How do I ensure that I won’t be charged?,"We’ll never charge you unless you decide to move to pay-as-you-go pricing. If you move to pay as you go, you’ll only be charged for services that you use above the free monthly amounts. You can check your usage of free services in the Azure portal."
Do I have to pay something after 30 days or after I use up my credit?,"At the end of your first 30 days or after you spend your $200 credit (whichever comes first), we'll ask you if you want to move to pay-as-you-go pricing. If you move to pay as you go, you'll keep getting free services and you'll only pay for what you use beyond the free monthly amounts. If you don't move to pay as you go, you can't purchase Azure services beyond your $200 credit—and eventually your account and services will be disabled."
Can I skip the 30 days and just start with pay-as-you-go pricing?,"Yes. You can sign up directly for pay as you go. This will enable you to immediately use services beyond the free amounts at pay-as-you-go rates. You'll still get monthly free amounts of popular services for 12 months and more than 55 services that are always free, but you won't receive the $200 credit."
What happens once I use my $200 free credit or I’m at the end of 30 days?,"We’ll notify you so you can decide if you want to move to pay-as-you-go pricing, enabling you to purchase Azure services beyond free amounts. If you do, you’ll keep getting access to all the free services. If you don’t, your account and services will be disabled. To resume usage, you'll need to move to pay as you go."
What does it mean to upgrade my account to pay as you go?,"When you sign up for an Azure free account, you get $200 credit. In the first 30 days, any services you use beyond their free amounts will be deducted from that $200 credit. When you've used up your $200 credit or 30 days have passed (whichever happens first), you'll need to upgrade by moving to pay-as-you-go pricing. That way, you can keep getting free amounts of services and purchase services beyond their free amounts as needed. The cost of those services is charged to the payment method you provide."
What happens with the services if I don’t move to pay as you go?,"If you decide not to move to pay-as-you-go pricing after your first 30 days or once you've used up your $200 credit (whichever happens first), any services you've deployed will be decommissioned and you won't be able to access them. To regain access, move to pay as you go within the following 30 days."
How do I know how much of the $200 credit I have left?,"You can see your remaining credit under Microsoft Cost Management in the Azure portal."
What happens to my unused credit if I upgrade before the end of 30 days?,"If you move to pay-as-you-go pricing before the end of 30 days, you won’t lose your credit. When you move to pay as you go, any credit you have remaining will still be available for the full 30 days from when you created your free account."
What happens at the end of the 12 months?,"Once you move to pay-as-you-go pricing, certain types of popular services are available in free monthly amounts for 12 months. If you're using any of these services after 12 months, they'll continue to run and you'll be billed at pay-as-you-go rates. You'll continue to receive monthly free amounts of more than 55 services that are always free."
What do I need to sign up for a free account?,"All you need is a phone number, a credit card or a debit card (non-prepaid), and a Microsoft account username (formerly Windows Live ID)."
